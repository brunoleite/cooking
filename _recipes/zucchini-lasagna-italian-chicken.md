## Time
**Prep:** 10m | **Cook:** 10m | **Makes:** 8 Servings

## Ingredients
* 4 zucchini medium
* 1 onion small, chopped
* 2 cloves garlic minced
* 1 tablespoon avocado oil
* 1 pound Italian ground chicken
* 2 cups marinara sauce divided 1/2 cup, 1/2 cup, and 1/2-1 cup
* 16 ounces whole milkricotta
* 1/4 cup egg whites
* 1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
* 1 teaspoon basil
* 1 teaspoon oregano
* 4 ounces mozzarella cheese

## Directions
Preheat oven to 350F
1. Use a mandolin on the largest setting to make zucchini noodles.
2. Place zucchini on cooking sheets and bake for 10 minutes to help dry them out (DO NOT SKIP)
3. Saute onion and garlic for 3-4 minutes until tender and translucent. Add in ground chicken and Saute for about 5 minutes until almost fully cooked. Add in 1/2 cup marinara and cook for another 5 minutes.
4. While chicken is cooking layer 1/2 cup marinara on the bottom of a 9 x 13 pan. When zucchini is done baking, line the bottom of the dish with one layer of zucchini noodles.
5. Mix ricotta, egg white, parmesan cheese and seasonings in a large bowl. When meat mixture is done cooking add it into the bowl and mix well.
6. Layer 1/2 the mixture over the zucchini noodles. Add another layer of zucchini and layer the rest of the meat mixture on top.
7. Layer the last layer of zucchini noodles over the top. Next spread 1/2 -1 cup marinara over the top. Layer with 4 ounces mozzarella cheese.
8. Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes, remove foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes.

## Recipe Notes
1. Zucchini is extremely watery, you must remove excess water.  This is part of what makes this recipe time consuming but so worth it.  I tried both methods baking the zucchini for 15-20 minutes & salting it for 10 minutes.  I thought the baking was worth it as far as how much drier it made the zucchini.
2. I opted to use whole milk ricotta and a little less mozzarella for more flavor.  (Trust me I bought the fat free ricotta and the whole milk ricotta.  Fat-free taste like cardboard paste, treat yo self and get the good stuff.  
3. Look for no sugar added and no oil marinara like TJ's traditional marinara.
