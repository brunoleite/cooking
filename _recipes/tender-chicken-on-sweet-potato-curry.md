## Time
**Prep:** 20m | **Cook:** 20m | **Makes:** 8 Servings

## Ingredients
* 400 ml Coconut Milk
* 1 Pack of Craisins
* 1 kg Chicken Breast  
* 2 Cans Chickpeas
* 20 g Fresh Parsley
* 2 Cloves Garlic
* 2 Red Onions
* 2 Sweet Potatoes
* 2 Broccoli
* Curry Powder to Taste
* Salt & Pepper to Taste
* Olive Oil

## Directions
1. Set the oven to 220°C (hot air: 200°C). Peel and cut sweet potatoes into approx. 2 cm pieces.
2. Cut broccoli into about 2 cm large bouquets. Peel a stalk of broccoli and cut it into small pieces.
3. Peel, slice and cut onions into thin slices. Peel the garlic and dice it. Pick and finely chop parsley.
4. Pour the chickpeas into a strainer, but save the chickpea broth.
5. Mix sweet potatoes, broccoli, onions and chickpeas with 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt and pepper and spread on a baking sheet with parchment paper.
6. Roast everything in the oven for 15-20 minutes, until the vegetables are a little crispy at the edges. *
7. Wipe the meat with some kitchen paper. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small frying pan. Fry the meat on medium heat for 1-2 minutes on each side and season with salt and pepper.
8. Then place the meat on the baking tray with the vegetables and fry in the oven for 8-10 minutes, until the meat is completely cooked through.
9. Fry garlic and craisins in a medium saucepan with 1-2 tablespoons olive oil on medium heat for 1-2 min.
10. Sprinkle with curry powder to taste and add coconut milk. Let everything simmer for 4-5 minutes and add, if necessary, a little chickpea broth.
11. Cut the meat into thin slices. Turn the oven-baked vegetables into the sauce and season with salt and pepper.
12. Place the curry on plates and top with the chicken. Garnish with parsley and serve.
* A little tip: Save some space on the baking tray for the meat or use two baking trays.
