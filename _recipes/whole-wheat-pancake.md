## Time
**Prep:** 15m | **Cook:** 60m | **Makes:** 8 - 4 inch (10 cm) pancakes. Serves 3-4 people.

## Ingredients
* 1 cup (130 grams) whole wheat flour
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1/4 teaspoon salt
* 2 tablespoons (28 grams) brown sugar
* 1 large egg, lightly beaten
* 1 cup (240 ml) milk or oat milk
* 2 tablespoons (28 grams) canola oil

## Directions
1. In a large bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.
2. In a separate bowl whisk together the egg, milk, and melted butter. 
3. Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and then pour in the egg mixture, all at once, and stir (with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon) just until combined. The batter should have some small lumps. (Do not over mix the batter or the pancakes will be tough.)
4. Heat a frying pan or griddle over medium high heat until a few sprinkles of water dropped on the pan or griddle splatter. Adjust the temperature as needed. Can also use an electric griddle with the temperature set at 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Using a piece of paper towel or a pastry brush, lightly brush the pan with oil (or spray with a non stick vegetable spray.)
5. Using a small ladle or scoop, pour about 1/4 cup (60 ml) of pancake batter onto the hot pan, spacing the pancakes a few inches apart. When the bottoms of the pancakes are brown and bubbles start to appear on the top surfaces of the pancakes (2-3 minutes), turn over. Cook until lightly browned (about 1-2 minutes).
6. Repeat with remaining batter, brushing the pan with melted butter or oil between batches.
7. Serve immediately with butter and maple syrup.

## Bonus

For Blueberry Pancakes: Sprinkle fresh or frozen blueberries (prefer wild blueberries) on the tops of the pancakes just as bubbles start to appear on the top surface of the frying batter.
