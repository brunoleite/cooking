## Directions
1. Preheat the oven to 240°C. Peel and cut sweet potatoes into 0.5 cm thin slices. Cut peppers into four parts, remove the seeds and cut into 1-2 cm thin strips. Tear lime zest, then share the lime and squeeze out the juice.

3. Roast the vegetables in the oven for 18-20 min. Cut the broccoli into 2-3 cm large bouquets and turn these into the rest of the soy sauce and 1 pinch of pepper. Spread on the baking sheet with the rest of the vegetables after 10 minutes and let it toast.
4. Tap the lemongrass lightly and divide in half. Peel and grate the garlic and ginger. Cut the spring onion into thin slices.
5. Dry the meat and divide it horizontally. Season the fillets with 1 pinch of salt and pepper.
6. Fry the meat in 1 tablespoon oil on high heat for 1-2 minutes, until it is nicely golden brown. Remove the meat and save the pan.
7. Add lemongrass, garlic and ginger to the pan together with 1 tablespoon oil and fry for about 1 minute on medium heat.
8. Add the coconut milk and 0.5–0.75 dl of water. Bring the sauce to a boil and season with salt and pepper.
9. Put the meat in the pan and let the sauce simmer on medium heat for 6-7 min. Remove the lemongrass and taste the sauce with the rest of the lime juice, salt and pepper.
