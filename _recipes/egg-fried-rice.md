## Time
**Prep:** 10m | **Cook:** 15m | **Makes:** 6 Servings

## Ingredients
* 1/4 cup oyster sauce
* 1 tablespoon soy sauce (I use low-sodium) _plus additional to taste_
* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter _divided, or butter with canola oil spread_
* 3 large eggs _lightly beaten_
* 1 tablespoon canola oil
* 1 large red, yellow, or orange bell pepper _cut into 1/4-inch dice (about 1 1/4 cups)_
* 1 bag frozen peas and carrots _thawed (12 ounces)_
* 1 cup frozen shelled edamame _thawed (optional, but great for extra protein)_
* 2 cloves garlic _minced_
* 2 1/2 cups COLD cooked brown rice _break up large clumps with your fingers_
* 1/2 cup chopped green onions _about 3 medium_
* Red pepper flakes _Sriracha, or hot sauce of choice (optional)_

## Directions
1. In a small bowl, stir together the oyster sauce and soy sauce. Set aside. Grab a small bowl and a large, flexible rubber spatula, and keep both handy.
2. Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat until hot, about 2 minutes. Add 1/2 tablespoon butter and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan. Add the eggs, and cook without stirring until they barely start to set, about 20 seconds. With your spatula, scramble and break the eggs into little, bite-sized pieces. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, until eggs are just cooked through but not yet browned, about 1 additional minute. Transfer eggs to the small bowl and set aside.
3. Return the skillet to the heat, and increase the heat to high. Let the skillet warm until it is nice and hot, about 1 minute. Add the canola oil, and swirl to coat. Add the diced bell pepper, and cook until it is crisp-tender, about 4 minutes.
4. Add the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons butter, peas and carrots, and edamame. Cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds (do not let the garlic burn!).
5. Add the brown rice and the oyster sauce mixture. Continue cooking, stirring constantly and breaking up any remaining rice clumps, until the mixture is heated through, about 3 minutes.
6. Add reserved eggs and green onions. Cook and stir until the mixture is completely heated through, about 1 minute more. Enjoy immediately with a sprinkle of red pepper flakes or dash of hot sauce and additional soy sauce as desired.

### Recipe Notes

* **To Store:** Let your cooked homemade fried rice come to room temperature and place it in the refrigerator in an airtight storage container for up to 5 days.
* **To Reheat:** Place your fried rice on a microwave-safe plate or in a bowl and microwave for 1 minute or until warmed through.
* **To Freeze:** Once your homemade fried rice has cooled, place it in a freezer-safe container or zip-top bag, removing as much air as possible. Freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then reheat as directed.
* **Ingredient Note:** Oyster sauce is readily available in the Asian or international food aisle of most major grocery stores. It has a unique flavor and texture, and if you substitute something else for it, your fried rice won’t taste the same. If you’d like to experiment with making the recipe without oyster sauce, you can simply omit it or swap in 1 tablespoon of sesame oil to add flavor.
