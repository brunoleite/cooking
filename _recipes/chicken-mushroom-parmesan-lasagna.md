## Time
**Prep:** 20m | **Cook:** 20m | **Makes:** 4 Servings

## Ingredients
* 6-9 boiled, whole wheat lasagna noodles
* 2 pounds cooked, shredded boneless chicken breast
* 1 tablespoon olive oil
* 1 onion, chopped
* 6 garlic cloves, minced
* 4 cups sliced mushrooms, chopped
* 4 cups raw spinach
* 3 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
* 3 cups freshly shaved parmesan cheese
* 3 cups tomato sauce
* fresh basil for garnish

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add olive oil. 
3. Add onions and saute until soft, about 5-6 minutes. 
4. Add mushrooms and cook for another 3-4 minutes. 
5. Stir in garlic and spinach and cook until spinach wilts. 
6. Fold in cooked, shredded chicken, turn off heat and mix in 1/2 cup of each cheese.
7. Spray a nonstick baking dish with nonstick spray (I used a 9 x 6 baking dish). 
8. Lay two lasagna noodles on the bottom of the dish (it’s okay if they overlap), then layer some of the chicken mixture on top. 
9. Spoon some tomato sauce on next, then sprinkle on some of each cheese – add as much or as little sauce and cheese as you’d like.
10. Add two mote lasagna noodles on top and repeat the entire process until you reach the top. I was able to get four layers, but it just depends on your baking dish size. Once you get to the top, add shredded cheese to finish it off.
11. Set baking dish on a baking sheet and bake for 35 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes, then serve with fresh basil for garnish.
