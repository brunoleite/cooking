## Time
**Prep:** 20m | **Cook:** 10m | **Makes:** 4 Servings

## Ingredients

### For the Chicken:
* 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs or breasts cut into bite-sized pieces (thighs will be more tender)
* 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 3 tablespoons cornstarch

### For the Stir Fry:
* 2 tablespoons sesame oil divided
* 1 tablespoon canola oil or grapeseed oil or another neutral cooking oil
* 1 bunch scallions about 5 or 6, cut diagonally into 2-inch pieces
* 2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger
* 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 2 tablespoons minced garlic about 6 cloves
* 2 tablespoons sesame seeds
* 1/2 cup chopped fresh basil or cilantro
* Cooked Instant Pot Brown Rice quinoa, or Cauliflower Fried Rice, for serving

### For the Sauce:
* 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce
* 3 tablespoons water
* 2 tablespoons honey
* 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch

## Instructions
1. Place the chicken in a bowl and sprinkle with the salt and pepper. With a large spoon, stir to coat. Sprinkle the cornstarch over the top, then stir once more, ensuring the pieces are evenly coated.
2. Stir together the sauce: in a liquid measuring cup with a spout, stir together the soy sauce, honey, water, vinegar, and cornstarch. Keep near the stove. Make sure your ginger and garlic are minced and ready to go and that you have all of the ingredients and measuring spoons you will need close to the stove (stir fries move fast).
3. Heat a heavy-duty 12-inch skillet (well-seasoned cast iron or nonstick both work well) or a wok over high heat, until it is very hot, 2 to 4 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon of the sesame oil and the canola oil and swirl to coat the pan. Let the oil heat for about 15 seconds, then add the green onions, ginger, and red pepper flakes. Cook, stirring constantly for 1 minute. Stir in the garlic and cook 30 seconds.
4. Add the remaining tablespoon of sesame oil and the chicken, and cook, stirring periodically, 4 to 5 minutes. Give the sauce a quick stir, then pour into the skillet. Simmer until the sauce thickens and the chicken cooks through, 2 to 4 minutes.
5. Remove from the heat and stir in the sesame seeds and basil or cilantro. Taste and adjust for seasoning as desired. Serve warm with rice.
